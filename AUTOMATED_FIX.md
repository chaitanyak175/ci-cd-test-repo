# Automated Fix

## Fix Applied:
**Description:** To diagnose the actual pipeline failure, you must provide the correct, human-readable text logs from the failed step. The current data is unusable. Please follow these steps to retrieve the correct logs from the GitHub Actions run.

**Steps:**
1. Step 1: Navigate to the failed workflow run on GitHub at: https://github.com/chaitanyak175/Unknown/actions/runs/17192302962 (Note: 'Unknown' is a placeholder for your repository name).
2. Step 2: Click on the specific job that failed (it will be marked with a red 'X').
3. Step 3: In the left-hand pane, locate the step that failed. It will also be marked with a red 'X'. Click on it to expand the log output.
4. Step 4: Copy the full text content from the expanded log window for the failed step. This will be the actual error message.
5. Step 5: Provide the copied text log for a new analysis. Do not use the 'Download log archive' option unless you first unzip the file and then copy the text from the relevant log file within it.

## Instructions:
Please review the suggested changes and apply them manually if needed.
